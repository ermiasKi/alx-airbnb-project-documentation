# Airbnb Backend Clone

This project is a backend clone of Airbnb, built to replicate key functionalities of the platform using modern backend technologies. It provides a robust foundation for a property rental platform, including user management, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and optimized data handling.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Secure system for user registration, login, authentication, and profile management.

- **Property Management**  
  Create, update, and retrieve property listings with detailed information.

- **Booking System**  
  Allow users to book properties, manage reservations, and track booking history.

- **Payment Processing**  
  Integrated payment system for handling transactions and securely storing payment details.

- **Review System**  
  Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties to help inform other travelers.

- **Data Optimization**  
  Efficient database design and optimizations for fast data retrieval and storage.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## üë• Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## üì¶ Database Design

### Users
- **Fields**: id, name, email, password, date_joined  
- **Description**: Users can book properties, leave reviews, and manage their bookings.

### Properties
- **Fields**: id, owner_id, title, description, location, price_per_night  
- **Description**: A user (owner) can list multiple properties for rent.

### Bookings
- **Fields**: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date, total_price  
- **Description**: A booking links a user to a property for a specific date range.

### Reviews
- **Fields**: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment, created_at  
- **Description**: Users can leave reviews for properties they have stayed at.

### Payments
- **Fields**: id, booking_id, user_id, amount, payment_date, status  
- **Description**: Payments are linked to bookings and track the transaction details.

## üîê API Security

### Authentication
We will implement secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure only verified users can access the system.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to manage permissions, ensuring that users can only access resources they are authorized for.

### Rate Limiting
We will apply rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests per user or IP in a given time frame.

### Data Protection
All sensitive data, such as passwords and payment details, will be encrypted and securely stored.

**Why Security is Crucial:**  
Security ensures the protection of user data, prevents unauthorized access, and maintains trust in the platform. It‚Äôs especially critical for safeguarding sensitive operations like payments and personal information.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, enabling faster and more reliable development.

We will use tools like **GitHub Actions** and **Docker** to automate testing, containerization, and deployment, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.

**Why CI/CD Matters:**  
CI/CD improves development efficiency, reduces human error, and ensures that updates are safely and quickly delivered to users, helping maintain high project quality.
